# Symmetric Polynomials
This is a header-only C++ library for computing decompositions of symmetric polynomials with relations. Please see this <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Symmetric_Polynomials/html/math.html">page</a> for more details on the math involved and this <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Symmetric_Polynomials/html/index.html">page</a> for a user guide.

There are two ways you can use it:

* For a quick demonstration you can get the binary for Windows or Linux from the <a href="https://github.com/NickG-Math/Symmetric_Polynomials/releases">releases</a>. 
* To get started with using the C++ library, there is an extensive user-guide/tutorial on this <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Symmetric_Polynomials/html/index.html">page</a>.

What follows is a very brief installation guide taken from the more extensive <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Symmetric_Polynomials/html/index.html">documentation</a>.

# Requirements
* A C++17 compiler.

# Installation
* To install simply clone/download this repository and include the "source" folder in your path.
* See this <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Symmetric_Polynomials/html/use.html">page</a> for details on how to call the library from your source code.
