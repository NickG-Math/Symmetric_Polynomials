# Symmetric Polynomials
This is a project devoted to computing decompositions of symmetric polynomials involving relations. 

There are two ways you can use it:

* For a quick demonstration you can get the binary for Windows or Linux from <a href="https://github.com/NickG-Math/Symmetric_Polynomials/releases">here</a>. 
Note: The Mac and Linux binaries must be executed from a terminal.
* To get started with using the C++ library, there is a user-guide/tutorial on this <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Symmetric_Polynomials/docs/html/index.html">page</a> for details on how to use it.
There, you will also find extensive documentation for every method and class of the project.
