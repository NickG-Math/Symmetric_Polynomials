# Symmetric Polynomials
This is a header-only C++ library for computing decompositions of symmetric polynomials with relations. Please see this <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Symmetric_Polynomials/docs/html/index.html">page</a> for a lot more details.

There are two ways you can use it:

* For a quick demonstration you can get the binary for Windows or Linux from <a href="https://github.com/NickG-Math/Symmetric_Polynomials/releases">here</a>. 
* To get started with using the C++ library, there is an extensive user-guide/tutorial on this <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Symmetric_Polynomials/docs/html/index.html">page</a>.
