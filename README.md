# Symmetric Polynomials
This is a header-only C++ library for computing decompositions of symmetric polynomials with relations. Please see this <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Symmetric_Polynomials/html/math.html">page</a> for more details on the math involved and this <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Symmetric_Polynomials/html/index.html">page</a> for a user guide.

There are two ways you can use it:

* For a quick demonstration you can get the binary for Windows or Linux from the <a href="https://github.com/NickG-Math/Symmetric_Polynomials/releases">releases</a>. 
* To get started with using the C++ library, there is an extensive user-guide/tutorial on this <a href="https://nickg-math.github.io/Symmetric_Polynomials/html/index.html">page</a>.
