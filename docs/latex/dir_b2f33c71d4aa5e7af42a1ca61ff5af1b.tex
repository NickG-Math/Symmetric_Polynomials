\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{Demo_8cpp}{Demo.\+cpp}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em A demonstration file that can be compiled. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{General_8h}{General.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Contains general operations on vectors (eg hashing, adding), the class of rational numbers, and methods for applying permutations on vectors. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{Generators_8h}{Generators.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Contains generators of all monomials with desired degree and satisfying a desired policy. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{Half__Idempotent_8h}{Half\+\_\+\+Idempotent.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em If \$\$R=\textbackslash{}mathbb Q\mbox{[}x\+\_\+1,...,x\+\_\+n,y\+\_\+1,...,y\+\_\+n\mbox{]}/(y\+\_\+i$^\wedge$2=y\+\_\+i)\$\$, the goal is to produce algebra generators for the fixed points of R under the $\Sigma_n$ action (permuting the $x_i,y_i$ separately), give an algorithm for writing a fixed point in terms of the generators and an algorithm for producing the relations of those generators. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{Permutations_8h}{Permutations.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Contains methods for producing permutations, orbits of monomials under symmetric group action, and writing symmetric polynomials in terms of elementary symmetric ones. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{Polynomials_8h}{Polynomials.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Contains the classes of monomials and polynomials in multiple variables with relations. ~\newline
 \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
file \mbox{\hyperlink{Relations_8h}{Relations.\+h}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em Contains two classes of relations on polynomial variables\+: no relations, and when half the variables are idempotents. Possible to extend by adding new types of relations. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
