\doxysubsection*{@section intro Introduction}

This is a C++ header only library devoted to computations of symmetric polynomials on variables having relations. You can find the Git\+Hub repository \href{https://github.com/NickG-Math/Symmetric_Polynomials}{\texttt{ here}}. You can also find binaries for Windows and Linux if you want a quick demonstration \href{https://github.com/NickG-Math/Symmetric_Polynomials/releases}{\texttt{ here}}.\hypertarget{md__media_kingfisher_NVME_Users_OWL_Google_Drive_GitHub_Symmetric_Polynomials_docs_Guide_req}{}\doxysubsection{Requirements}\label{md__media_kingfisher_NVME_Users_OWL_Google_Drive_GitHub_Symmetric_Polynomials_docs_Guide_req}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item A C++17 compiler, such as Clang (LLVM), GCC or MSVC.

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item To install simply clone/download the \href{https://github.com/NickG-Math/Symmetric_Polynomials}{\texttt{ repository}} and include the \char`\"{}source\char`\"{} folder in your path.
\item See the page \mbox{\hyperlink{use}{How to Use}} for a tutorial on using the library. For a brief explanation on the math behind it, see \mbox{\hyperlink{math}{The Math}}.
\item The latest version of the code is always tested with the latest stable versions of Clang, GCC (Linux) and MSVC (Windows). Remember to use the option {\ttfamily -\/std=c++17}.

This documentation is organized in pages as follows\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item The pages index, \mbox{\hyperlink{math}{The Math}}, \mbox{\hyperlink{use}{How to Use}}, explain how the program works.
\item The pages \href{namespaces.html}{\texttt{ Namespaces}}, \href{annotated.html}{\texttt{ Classes}} and \href{files.html}{\texttt{ Files}} are automatically generated by doxygen from the source code (and comments in the source code). These offer a much more in depth look into all classes and functions of this project. Note that only public and protected members of classes are documented.
\item I recommend starting with \mbox{\hyperlink{math}{The Math}} and then testing the code examples in \mbox{\hyperlink{use}{How to Use}}, before moving to the rest of the pages.
